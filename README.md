## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
[As I finished the first task of the light and memory game, I encountered a difficult obstacle in task 2: Record a gif of all the implemented features. First, I watched the ten minute video on Repository, Commit, and push using GitHub Desktop. It wasn't really helpful because it mostly taught me how to use the app on a Mac. I'm using a Windows laptop so it wasn't of help to me. Then, I went to record the gif video using QuickTime, which doesn't require downloading to function. I can install the extension to use it, but it wouldn't function due to my laptop being windows so I tried using Recordit, but it wouldn't function after downloading. I started being doubtful because I used this one day to get it done. I was able to solve the recording of the Gif with help from my friend: Samir Zelaya. He taught me how to use the LICEcap to record two versions of the website. First we ran a test run to see if the recording software functions well. For instance, the pause, start and stop recording button. All the features were functioning and I started recording the actual websites: One a Gif of me winning and the second video of me losing.]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[A few questions that came across my mind were: Is creating the website meaningful and beneficial to the individuals checking it? I checked to ensure all the features of the unique light and memory requirements were met. I even create a small personalized feature with the start and stop button to make them vibrant with colors. Another question I had is what other games or programs can you create with HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript? What other programming languages are used in web development instead Javascript, HTML6, and Css? Who invented Web Development? What is the direction of the Web developer career in the next 5 years?]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[If I had a few more hours to work on this project, I would add another function that showed the score of the amount of time that someone has gotten the patterns correct. I would add a reward system that makes a catchy sound and displays a message that displays”Keep going, you’re close to winning.” Another function that I create are numbers that quickly appear under the pattern to show how many times it was clicked. It would help the players  memorize the patterns better by putting forth effort to recall their last clicks when moving onto the next pattern.]
